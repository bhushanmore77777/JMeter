1.With 10 users,all users are hitting server in the time span of 1min
2.User are Visiting 3 pages
3.All users are hitting all pages at same time
4.My URL could be change in future(Keep in mind)
5.Verify all request should perform its task within 5 seconds else make it fail with reason
6.we should not get "ERROR" or "WARNING" text in any of the response
7.Generate tabular report and graph as well



1.With 10 users,all users are hitting server in the time span of 1min
  -Test Plan-->Add-->Threads(Users)-->Thread Group
  -Thread Group-->Name-->Test Case1
  -No.of threads(users)=10
  -Ramp up=60sec(1 min)

2.User are visiting 3 pages 
  -Create 3 Samplers
  -Test Case 1-->Samplers-->HttpRequest(Name=Req1)
  -Test Case 1-->Samplers-->HttpRequest(Name=Req2)
  -Test Case 1-->Samplers-->HttpRequest(Name=Req3)

   1.In Req1=server name/IP=www.thetestingworld.com
     //we are visiting homepage by using 1st req
   2.In Req2=server name/IP=www.thetestingworld.com/jmeter-tutorial
     //we are visiting sql testers
   3.In Req3=server name/IP=www.thetestingworld.com/soapUI
    //we are visiting linux testers

3.My URL can be change in future
   Test Case 1-->Add-->Config Element-->HTTP Request Defaults
   In HTTP Request Defaults-->server name/IP=www.thetestingworld.com(Add Base URL)
   1.In Req.1-->server name/IP=make empty because we have already enter same URL in HTTP Request Defaults
      path=/
   2.In Req2.-->server name/IP=empty
      path=/jmeter-tutorial
   3.In Req3.-->server name/IP=empty
      path=/soapUI

4.Before going to each of the page,we need to have some waiting time
  -when user is in 1st page-->after that if user is going in 2nd page there will be some delay time
  -Timer has more priority than samplers
  -In Req2 Req2-->Timer-->Constant Timer(3000ms)
   //first Req1 will be hit then timer then Req2
  -Req3-->Timer-->Constant Timer(3000ms)

5.Generate Tabular Report and graph as well
  
  Test Case 1-->Listener-->View Results in Tree
  Test Case 1-->Listener-->View Results in Table
  Test Case 1-->Listener-->Aggregate Graph
