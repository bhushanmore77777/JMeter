Latency=-within how much time website responds
Counter=e.g If there are 10 courses if we move to course 1
        -url will be /course/1
        -if we have to check all courses that will cause repetation
        -here we make user defined variable courseNumber
        -here counter used-->counter start(from where we have to starts)
                             Increment=1
                             Maximum=10 upto 10
Sampler(HTTP Request)-->Add-->Config Element-->User defined variables
In User Define Variables-->Add
 Name         Value
courseNumber  1
In HTTP Request/sampler
path=/course/${courseNumber}
In HTTP Request(course1)(Test Case 1)-->Add-->config element-->counter

******Template******
-Used for performing activity again and again

******Think Time******
-e.g Time required for filling login form

******Pacing******
-Time between iterations
-e.g we have to make 500 FundTransfer with 50 users in 1hr(60min)
-50-->50 FundTransfer--->2 min
-50-->50 FundTransfer--->2 min
-50-->50 FundTransfer--->2 min
-50-->50 FundTransfer--->2 min
-50-->50 FundTransfer--->2 min
-50-->50 FundTransfer--->2 min
-50-->50 FundTransfer--->2 min
-50-->50 FundTransfer--->2 min
-50-->50 FundTransfer--->2 min
-50-->50 FundTransfer--->2 min
-50 FundTransfer*10 iterations=500 FundTransfer
-Pacing=2min*10iterations=20min and remaining=60min-20min=40 min
-pacing=40min
-we have to divide that 40 min and used in between iterations
-if we cannot do it will achieve 500(20min)+500(20min)+500(20min)=1500(60min)
-it is ok in stress test
-in load test it is not ok
