-Whenever we are visiting website for the first time then we hit the request to
 server and we get the response from server
-In that it will store response like fonts,css whatever looking in the page in
 the form of cache in localstorage
-if we hit the request 2nd time then server will not give response 
 localstorage will give response and it will be faster than 1st
-so it is quick
